# Environmental Assessment of Noise and Dust Pollution in Hillingdon

This repository contains the code and data visualisations for the project "Environmental Assessment of Noise and Dust Pollution: A Case Study in the London Borough of Hillingdon." The project aims to evaluate the impact of environmental pollutants, specifically noise and dust, on the local communities within Hillingdon. This assessment is critical in understanding the extent of pollution and its potential risks to public health and the environment.

## Project Overview

The project was conducted as part of a larger environmental study focused on pollution monitoring within urban areas. We collected data on noise levels and dust concentrations across multiple sites in Hillingdon, using both field measurements and statistical analysis to identify trends and areas of concern.

### Objectives:
- Assess noise pollution levels in various locations within Hillingdon.
- Measure dust concentration and particulate matter (PM) in the air.
- Identify hotspots where pollution exceeds safe thresholds.
- Provide recommendations for mitigating the impacts of these pollutants.

## Data and Methodology

### Data Collection
The data was collected using environmental monitoring equipment deployed at strategic locations throughout Hillingdon. Noise levels were measured in decibels (dB), while dust concentration was assessed by measuring particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) using air quality sensors.

### Data Analysis and Visualisation
The analysis was conducted using Python, with libraries such as `Pandas`, `Matplotlib`, and `Seaborn` for data manipulation and visualisation. The repository includes:

- **Noise Level Analysis**: Visualisation of noise data, including time series graphs and heat maps to identify peak noise periods and locations.
- **Dust Concentration Analysis**: Graphs illustrating dust levels across different areas, highlighting areas where concentrations exceed recommended health guidelines.
- **Correlation Studies**: Scatter plots and correlation matrices to explore the relationship between noise and dust pollution.
